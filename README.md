# Todo List React Application
A simple, minimalist React web application built for organising your daily tasks.

The project was set up using Vite. Vite is a fast, modern local development server for React (and more, including Vue or Svelte) apps. The app was built using the free and open-source front-end React JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. Material UI, a React components library was used to provide good looking easy to use pre-built components to speed up the frontend development process.

This document outlines what the project looks like and how to get a copy running on your local machine.
